## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

The browser sends a request to the server, which is done over the internet. The server then sends
the necessary information back to the browser, and the browser then loads the assets through an
object-oriented program (JavaScript, HTML, etc) and displays it.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

Text loads first, followed shortly by the buttons and clickable links, and finally, the images load.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

All client-side code is used in the rendering of the browser.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

Server-side code is used in conjunction with databases and files.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

Client-side code is used for the object-oriented programming on the end user's computer.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

One instance of client-side assets is created.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

Different sites have a different amount of server-side code available to use. Any number
can be used, from only one to over twenty.

## What is runtime?

Runtime is the amount of time it takes to complete all tasks in a program.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

Since database connections are finite and expensive, many sites use connection pooling to
maintain several connections. However, only one connection is used client-side.
